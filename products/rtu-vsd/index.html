  <p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"><strong>SALCAN Process Technology</strong>&nbsp;have developed their well head control logic and have successfully implemented and proven this software on multiple CSG wells.</p>
  
  <p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Key features of the logic include the ability to control the:</p>
  
  <ul style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">
      <li>Automatic pump speed modulation to draw the water level down at an Operator defined rate, specified in metres&nbsp;per day. This allows full automatic control during the draw down phase with no Operator interventions required.</li>
      <li>Fixed water level control. This allows full automatic control once the well reaches desorption and ensures that the pump is always protected.</li>
      <li>Various algorithms for control of gas casing pressure, gas flow rate, and protection against downstream over-pressure.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">We&nbsp;can offer either:</p>
  
  <ol style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">
      <li>The&nbsp;<strong>SALCAN Process Technology</strong>&nbsp;Well Head Controller solution based on the Schneider Electric SCADAPack platform, or</li>
      <li>A Well Head Controller based on a clients chosen platform. We are comfortable working with many platforms.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">We offer a complete solution, from well head skid and RTU panel design through to control logic, local HMI, telemetry and networking, to remote SCADA capabilities.</p>
  
  <p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The RTU (Remote Telemetry Unit) is the "brains" of the well head equipment and adjusts its output and logic based on input signals received from the gas well. The RTU operates as a standalone controller and maintains safe operation of the well in the event of loss of communication to the SCADA system. &nbsp;</p>
  
  <p style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">The SCADAPack RTU offers many advantages to an end user including:</p>
  
  <ul style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">
      <li>DNP3 capability, minimising the risk of loss of your valuable gas well process data. Read more about how DNP3 works&nbsp;<a href="http://salcanpt.com/technology-notes/archives/2012/12/02/dnp3/">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Remote code/logic update capability via ClearSCADA, reducing the costly need to visit site</li>
      <li>Ability to run an onboard flow computer with AGA capabilities in parallel with the well head control logic</li>
      <li>Enhanced integration features with ClearSCADA</li>
      <li>Sufficient on-board I/O and communication ports to integrate process all well head equipment i.e. VSD, Down-hole sensor, External Flow Computer, Gas Control Valve and numerous physical I/O</li>
  </ul>
